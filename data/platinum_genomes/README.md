# Platinum Genomes

Illumina have performed [whole-genome
sequencing](https://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes.html) on the 17 member
CEPH pedigree 1463.

>The whole pedigree was sequenced to 50x depth on a HiSeq 2000 system: NA12877,
NA12878, NA12879, NA12880, NA12881, NA12882, NA12883, NA12884, NA12885,
NA12886, NA12887, NA12888, NA12889, NA12890, NA12891, NA12892, and NA12893
(dbGaP accession: phs001224)

In addition:

>We have derived a set of high-confidence variant calls for NA12877 and
NA12878, by taking into account the inheritance constraints in the pedigree and
the concordance of variant calls across different methods.

See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Illumina/PlatinumGenomes) for more
