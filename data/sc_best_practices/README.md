A 10x Multiome data set generated for a single cell data integration challenge at the NeurIPS conference 2021 [Luecken et al., 2021]. This dataset captures single-cell multiomics data from bone marrow mononuclear cells of 12 healthy human donors measured at four different sites to obtain nested batch effects. In the [tutorial](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/preprocessing_visualization/quality_control.html#environment-setup-and-data), one batch of the aforementioned dataset, sample 4 of donor 8, was used to showcase the best practices for scRNA-seq data preprocessing.
