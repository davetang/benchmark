# SIMS

[SIMS: A deep-learning label transfer tool for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(24)00165-4).

## Datasets

1. PBMC68K, also known as Zheng68K, derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
2. Human heart dataset, also known as Tucker's dataset, comprising 11 cell types and exhibiting imbalanced cell clusters.
3. Human lung atlas dataset, also known as Krasnow's dataset containing 58 different cell types coming from three donors with a similar size to PBMC68K but more cell variety.
4. Human kidney dataset, also known as Stewart's dataset. It contains 34 different cell types coming from 14 different donors, totaling 40,268 mature kidney cells.
5. The human landscape dataset, also known as Han's dataset, with more than 584,000 cells and the presence of a wide array of different cell types coming from the entire body, totaling 102. Another characteristic of this dataset was the lower dimension from the feature perspective, as it was only sampling around 5,000 genes, in contrast to the other datasets comprising from around 20,000 to 45,000 features.
